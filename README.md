Dataset 
    Publicly available at (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/)
We provide a dataset that includes fMRI brain scan images, with a particular focus on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The key idea is to identify which particular region of the brain is more active, which has high blood flow, and hence diagnosis-related tasks could be approached using image analysis techniques. The image dataset is publicly available to be used to experiment with the usability of fmri augmentation of ADHD (early detection).It is believed that the dataset can allow for the development of further interesting applications using Deep Learning or image processing techniques. 

To run the code for the implementation described in"", you would typically follow these steps:
1. Obtain the Code: First, you need to access the code database. This may involve downloading it from a repository, it is publicly available at nitrc.org.We need to request that the database administrator for accessing the dataset. They will provide approval for accessing the ADHD-200 dataset.
2. System Specification: Ensure that your system meets the hardware and software specifications required to run the code. This might include specific hardware (e.g., GPU for deep learning tasks), software dependencies (e.g., Python libraries), and operating system compatibility.
3. Setup Environment: Set up the necessary environment for running the code. This typically involves creating a virtual environment and installing the required dependencies. You might use tools like Anaconda, pip, or Docker for this purpose.
4. Configuration: Check if there are any configuration files provided with the codebase, Adjust the settings according to your requirements, such as path to data, model hyper parameters, or any other configurable parameters.
5. Data Preparation: Prepare the input data required for the code to run. This might involve preprocessing, formatting, or organizing the data as per the code's expectations. Ensure that the data is compatible with the input requirements specified by the code.
6. Run the Code: Execute the code according to the provided instructions. This could involve running specific scripts or commands from the command line or using an integrated development environment (IDE) if available.
7. Monitor progress: Monitor the progress of the code execution and check for any errors or warnings. Debug as necessary and refer to documentation or resources provided with the codebase for troubleshooting.
8. Evaluation: Once the code has finished running, evaluate the results generated. This might involve analyzing output files, visualizations, or performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of the implemented approaches.
9. Interpretation: Interpret the results in the context of the research objectives and hypotheses. Consider implications, limitations, and potential future directions based on the findings.
